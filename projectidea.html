    <h1>Automation of a motor vehicle’s driving seat and mirror positioning when there are multiple drivers/users of any one vehicle</h1>
  </article>
      <article>
    <br>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This project is taking the focus of the use of motor vehicles: cars, and the user centred design of the drivers of such a car with their
      seating and mirrors positioning; key functional and observatory features of a common vehicle. Using innovative hardware such as a
      Raspberry Pi and the development of a software; it is believed that the drivers key observatory and functional features: the seat and
      mirrors and their positioning (their settings) can be managed, stored and automatically adjusted (on starting of the car) to better be
      suited when their is multiple dedicated drivers of one common 21st century car.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Motivation/Opportunity</h3>

      <p>
        When you have another person drive your vehicle or a vehicle you regularly use, they move the seat and mirrors and it can be annoying and a
        time wasting process to change them back every time and getting it perfect again when you go to drive the vehicle. What if you could manage,
        store, and automatically adjust each drivers’ personal settings; the seat and mirrors to accustom the dedicated driver (at the time) on start up every time.
        Some newer cars have memory buttons that save the driver’s seat and mirror (side and rear view) positions, but what if this could be implemented or
        integrated into almost any car of the 21st century using Raspberry Pi (small single board computer) technology with a developed software that stores,
        manages and actions adjustments?
      </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This product and software; the system as a whole, could potentially reach more of an audience if it was
      external to a car’s multiple computer/Electronic Control Unit (ECU) (for the drivers electronic seat and mirror: side and rear view) and
      running on a Raspberry Pi and dedicated software; as it could potentially function on more 21st century cars.  <br><br>
      The innovation of the Raspberry Pi: <br><br>
      A series of pocket sized single-board computers known as the The Raspberry Pi have taken over the world of automation and robotics.
      The innovative series of “Pi sized” computers was originally aimed “at promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing
      countries”, now it aids in solving an infinite number of problems.  The Raspberry Pi has the ability to replace our common desktop computers and some
      versions can be used as a USB (Universal Serial Bus) device or USB host; “plugged into another computer via a USB port on another machine”.
      With multiple configuration methods it can show up as a serial device or an ethernet device; with the ability to USB and network boot.
      Also noting that the latest Raspberry Pi 4 has complete POE (Power-over-Ethernet) support, through full gigabit ethernet, on-board Wifi and
      Bluetooth capability. (Wikipedia, 2020) <br><br>
    </p>
    <h4>Hardware and Software:  </h4>
    <ul class="text">
      <li class="text">The Raspberry Pi is to used to run the software (on the start up of the car) that will manage, store and run adjustments on the car’s
        drivers seat, side and rear view mirrors when a drivers/user settings (for position and angle) is selected.
      </li>
      <li class="text">Dependency on the features of the car: whether it has a touchscreen and/or Apple Carplay/Android Auto or not;

      <ul class="text">
        <li class="text">
          If the car has an touchscreen and/or Apple Carplay/Android Auto (like most modern cars have now); the Raspberry Pi will need to be plugged
          into the USB port for the car and just like a car picks up that a mobile phone has been plugged in and runs Apple Car Play or Android Auto,
          the car will pick up the Raspberry Pi as a device and run the software through the touchscreen on the interior console: USB boot
        </li>
        <li class="text">
          If the car does not have a touchscreen in the interior console, the Rasberry Pi will need a display; a small touchscreen monitor;
          five inch monitor (for example) that plugs into the Raspberry PI (will suit the Raspberry PI) that displays the software’s UI (User Interface) on startup;
          to select a driver’s/user’s profile and settings for the driver seat, side view mirrors and rear view mirrors, so the seats and mirrors position and angle
          can be automatically adjusted
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li class="text">
        The Raspberry Pi will need to be hard wired into the seats and mirrors (rear view and side) ECU (Electronic Control Unit) and also connected to the cars
        power source (e.g. be plugged into the 12 volt power adapter for power or power over usb: usb ports
      </li>
  </ul><br>

    <h4>Functionality/Operation/Setup: </h4><br>
    <h5>Initial Setup:</h5>
    <p>
    Once everything is plugged in and hardwired (the Rasberry PI is plugged into power or USB and a display: to show UI) and the car (that is used by multiple people) is turned on for the first time with the external device (the Raspberry Pi) that will (have software that will) manage, store and run adjustments on the car’s driver’s seat, side and rear view mirrors for each dedicated driver, there is an initial setup wizard that is a part of the software. The initial setup wizard or initial setup UI that will show on the display will be as follows:   <br><br>
    “Welcome to [TBC Software Name], what is your name?” <br><br>
    “_________________” [Click box and use on screen keyboard/external keyboard to type name] <br>
    “Next” <br>

    [Next page] <br><br>
    “Please adjust your seat (position and back angle) and mirrors (side and rear view) to your liking and then click Save.” <br><br>
    [Will need to manually adjust electronic seat and back angle and mirrors (side and rear view) to your liking with buttons/switches that
    manufacture has provisioned] <br><br>

    “Save” <br><br>
    [Next page]  <br><br>
    “Your profile name and settings have been saved, on next startup, these will be automatically adjusted (if not already) to accustom you, thank you.” <br>
    The software (that is to run on the Raspberry PI) is to:  <br><br>
    </p>
    <ul class="text">
      <li class="text">Manage
        <ul class="text">
          <li class="text">when changes are made manually on any one drivers profile/settings
            (the electronic driver seat is moved or the mirrors are moved; a notification will display in the software:<br>
            “Settings have been changed; would you like to save these for [Driver’s Profile Name]?”  <br>
            “Yes/No
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="text">Store and Run adjustments:
        <ul>
          <li class="text">Every drivers’ profile/settings will be stored in the software (once setup and saved); to choose (in the software’s UI) when the car is started;
            so the seat and mirrors can be automatically adjusted
          </li>
          <li class="text">UI will display as (when the car is started, and the software is running):  <br>
            “Hello, who is using this vehicle today?”
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

          <table>
           <!--First Row -->
           <tr>
             <td>“Driver Profile 1” </td>
             <td>“Driver Profile 2” </td>
             <td>“Driver Profile 3” </td>
             <td>“Setup New User” </td>
            </tr>
              </table>
            <p>(refer to above Initial setup) <br>
              Once a driver’s profile is selected, the automatic adjustments for the driver’s seat, side mirrors and
              rear mirrors will be run.

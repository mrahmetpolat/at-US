    <h2 class="itWork">What does it do?</h2>
      <p class="itWork">Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand human language.
        It is the art of teaching a computer how to read and speak “like a human”. We use NLP more often than you think as it is integrated into our everyday life such as Speech recognition
        (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant), ChatBots (The little chat boxes that appear on the bottom of websites offering modern-day virtual assistance for common issues of the customer) and
        Spellcheck (I am currently using Grammarly to structure these very sentences). Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce
        human-like text and is one of the most advanced examples of NLP. It has a capacity of 175 billion machine learning parameters.The quality of the text generated by GPT-3 is so high that it is difficult
        to distinguish from that written by a human, which has both benefits and risks.
      </p>
      <h2 class="itWork">What is the likely impact?</h2>
      <P class="itWork">
        A major way that NLP could impact the world is that as computers become better understanding complex “human language”, such as differentiating
        between when you yell “FIRE!” At a building that is on fire versus “FIRE!” When you tell say a marksman to shoot. Or another example would be when you say the word “sheep”
        and it looks in its language database and finds the word sheep but will probably then proceed to tell you that a sheep is black. It won’t say that the sheep is white because
        its very rare that we have to say a sheep is white as it is perceived as ‘common-sense’.
        It is when that computer can understand these ‘common-senses’ and important contexts in when words are said that we will be able to have seamless conversations about deep subjects and
        with emotions. Robots will be able to have AI that can talk just like you and I do. You could see NLP integrated even more into our everyday life, it could lead to a major upheaval of the service
        sector as you could potentially see AI with advance NLP replace the need for actual humans

      <h2>How has your opinion of your job title changed after seeing industry data? </h2>



      <h3>Data Scientist - Ahmet</h3>
      <p>The research proves that Data Science is a growing industry. Therefore, I still feel confident that Data Science is a good industry to focus my career on.
        The research also highlight that I also need to improve myself on 2 Non-IT specific skills to be able to work in this industry.
      </p>
      <h3>Senior Full Stack Developer - Jack</h3>
      <p>In the highlight of the industry data revealing 23.4% projected growth over the next 5 years, I still feel confident in the need for full-stack developers in the future.
        I do however need to put just as much emphasis on my Non-IT specific skills as my IT ones; They are just as in demand.
      </p>

      <h3>Store Manager - John</h3>
      <p>Despite a low projected growth, the demand for the manager of a store remains high and consistent. However, the main appeal of my ideal job is the independence of owning my own business.
        In this respect, the data is largely irrelevant as in most economic models, new businesses are always necessary.

      </p>
      <h3>Information Systems Technician – Luke</h3>
      <p>The data shows, that while the role does not have a high demand for highly regarded IT or non-IT skills, it still has a higher projected growth.
	  As someone who currently works in an IT Technician role, it is exciting to see that there is still a future and high regard for general IT Technicians, for a world that will be ever evolving and where technicians will have to be ever adapting.
      </p>
      <h3>Security Operations Centre Manager – Rob</h3>
      <p>The information highlighted here has not changed my view on the job. The job I selected in the first place was hypothetical. Having said this cyber security roles are in high demand and the requirement to protect networks, systems & assets of companies will not be going away any time soon.
      </p>


      <h3>Developer Programmer – Bibianna</h3>
      <p>After reviewing the industry data, my career ambition has been reaffirmed as both soft and hard skill sets can be applied throughout the industry in general and developer in particular. Apparently, the research has shown that Developer Programmer continues to grow in demand,
        and I have to equip myself with other general (non- IT) skills in order to excel in my career path. </p>
